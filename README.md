As you can see the values are a perfect mnatch.

As you can see the values are a once again a perfect mnatch.
##Questions 
####What did we create
####How does it work
####How can it be usefull in the context of computer memory 
##Analaysi and conclusion
Through this excercise I completed the same task in two different manners. I created a code to represent the figure in part 6 using stutural and beavioural programming. Though it seemed to be that behavioural was much easierier and look less time, I can see how with a bigger program structual programming would be usefull. Aslo I am happy to see that the outputs matched the truth table perfectly in both cases.
